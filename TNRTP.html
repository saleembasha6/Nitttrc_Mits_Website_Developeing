                    A large number of technologies have been developed by various research institutions and laboratories
                    in the form of appropriate technologies. But, the benefits of these technologies have failed to reach the
                    rural population. The villagers could not adopt these modern technologies and implements to improve
                    productivity, and, in turn, their quality of life, since the process of transfer of technologies was not
                    undertaken in a planned manner.
